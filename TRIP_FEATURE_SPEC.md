## 3. Technical Details

### 3.1 RPC Functions

#### Trip Creation & Detail

| Function | Migration | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `create_trip_with_details` | `008` | Create trip with all related records in one call |
| `get_trip_full_details` | `015` | Fetch complete trip with all relations as JSONB |
| `update_trip_status` | `026` | Change trip status with ownership validation |
| `update_trip_destination` | `027` | Update primary destination location + PostGIS geometry |
| `get_nearby_trips` | `002` | Find trips within radius (PostGIS) |
| `search_trips_optimized` | `002` | Full-text + spatial trip search with relevance score |

#### Trip Listing (used by `/trips` page tabs)

| Function | Migration | Parameters | Returns |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `get_user_owned_trips` | `011`, `025` | `p_user_id, p_search, p_status, p_limit, p_offset` | Trips owned by user + `member_count`, `visibility`, `total_count` |
| `get_user_member_trips` | `011` | `p_user_id, p_search, p_member_status, p_limit, p_offset` | Trips user joined (status = 'joined') + `role`, `owner_name`, `owner_avatar`, `total_count` — kept for legacy API use |
| `get_user_participating_trips` | `028` | `p_user_id, p_search, p_status, p_limit, p_offset` | All trips the user participates in (joined + pending request + invited) — excludes owned trips; adds `participation_status` ('joined'/'pending'/'invited'), `invitation_id` for invited rows + `total_count` |
| `get_recent_trips` | `011` | `p_user_id, p_search, p_tags, p_region, p_limit, p_offset` | Public active trips, block-filtered + `total_count` |
| `get_suggested_trips` | `011` | `p_user_id, p_limit` | Preference-scored trip suggestions + `match_score` |

#### Discovery & Recommendations

| Function | Migration | Parameters | Returns |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `get_discover_trips` | `010` | `p_user_id, p_search, p_region, p_budget, p_travel_style, p_pace, p_limit, p_offset` | Preference-filtered public trips + `total_count` |

#### Itinerary Management

> **Note:** The old itinerary RPCs (`create_stop_with_activities`, `update_itinerary_stop`, `delete_itinerary_stop`, `reorder_itinerary_stops`) were removed from `stops.ts` — they used wrong column names (`stop_type`, `name`, `location_name` which don't exist on `trip_location`). Actions now use **direct table operations** against `locations` + `trip_location`.

| Function | Migration | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `get_complete_itinerary` | `004` | Fetch all stops + nested activities as JSONB |
| `get_itinerary_with_metrics` | `005` | Stops with completion/time-accuracy metrics |
| `get_itinerary_performance_analytics` | `005` | Trip-level analytics (completion rates, time accuracy) |

**Direct table ops used by `stops` actions (no RPC):**

| Action | Operation | Tables |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `stops.createStop` | INSERT locations → INSERT trip_location | `locations`, `trip_location` |
| `stops.updateStop` | UPDATE locations + UPDATE trip_location | `locations`, `trip_location` |
| `stops.deleteStop` | DELETE trip_location; DELETE locations if orphaned | `trip_location`, `locations` |

### 3.2 Key Validation Rules

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| title | Min 3 characters |
| description | Min 10 characters |
| start_date | ≥ today |
| end_date | ≥ start_date |
| join_by | ≥ now() |
| max_pax | 2-50 |
| coordinates | Valid lat/lng range |

### 3.3 Auto-Calculated Fields

| Field | Calculation |
|-------|-------------|
| duration_days | (end_date - start_date) + 1 |
| budget_per_person | estimated_budget / max_pax |
| available_spots | max_participants - current_participants |

---

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Stability & Creation (P0)
- [x] ~~Create database migration for preferences_prompt_until~~
- [x] ~~Create get_discover_trips RPC function~~
- [x] ~~Rename "Recent" tab to "Discover" in /trips page~~
- [x] ~~Implement preference-based filtering for Discover tab~~
- [x] ~~Add PreferencesPrompt modal component~~
- [x] ~~Add Map Picker Modal component for location selection~~
- [x] ~~Add "Pick on map" buttons to Destination, Pickup, Dropoff fields~~
- [x] ~~Add Step 5 - Confirmation with map preview showing all locations~~
- [x] ~~Fix trip creation bugs (auth session, coordinate order, PostGIS trigger, trip_id ambiguity)~~
- [x] ~~Add Mapbox markers (destination/pickup/dropoff) to Step 5 confirmation map~~
- [x] ~~Remove legacy Itinerary.astro; use Itinerary2 with destination in header~~
- [x] ~~Ensure trip status transitions work correctly — `StatusModal` + `update_trip_status` RPC (migration 026)~~
- [ ] Verify member management works (join/leave/remove)
- [ ] Complete trip search and filtering

### Phase 2: Itinerary Enhancement (P1)
- [x] ~~Fix DaySection crash (`stops[0].stop` → `stops[0]`)~~
- [x] ~~Fix itinerary query: add `location:locations(*)` join; exclude only `destination` (pickup/dropoff are shown in timeline)~~
- [x] ~~Rewrite `createStop`/`updateStop` actions: correct DB columns (`location_type`, `location_id`); two-step INSERT into `locations` then `trip_location`~~
- [x] ~~Fix `deleteStop`: cleans up orphaned `locations` rows~~
- [x] ~~Fix `activityEditor.ts`: read `data-activity-type`/`data-activity-description`/`data-duration` from DOM instead of hardcoded `'photo_op'`~~
- [x] ~~Add `data-activity-type`, `data-activity-description`, `data-duration` to `ActivityList.astro` items~~
- [x] ~~Replace all `alert()`/`confirm()` in `stopEditor.ts` and `activityEditor.ts` with `showToast`/`createConfirmModal`~~
- [x] ~~Fix `hidden`+`flex` edit mode toggle conflict in `Itinerary.ts` — use `style.display` instead~~
- [x] ~~Fix `stopEditor.ts` field names: `name`→`location_name`, `stop_type`→`location_type` to match DB~~
- [x] ~~Delete dead files: `CompleteItinerary.astro` (520 lines, unused), `FormTemplates.astro` (309 lines, orphaned)~~
- [x] ~~Integrate Mapbox Search Box (suggest + retrieve) into inline add/edit stop forms; coordinates saved to `locations` table~~
- [x] ~~Fix DaySection.astro type mismatch: `CompleteStop[]` → `ItineraryStop[]`; `firstStop.stop?.scheduled_start` → `firstStop?.scheduled_start`~~
- [x] ~~Pickup/Dropoff stop type in Add Stop form; limits raised to 20 each (US18a)~~
- [x] ~~Time overlap validation on stop create/edit within a day — full interval + exact start-time collision; inline form error displayed, save blocked (US18b); new stop default time set to after last stop + 15 min~~
- [x] ~~Consolidated "Joined" tab: `get_user_participating_trips` RPC (028) unifies joined + pending + invited into single TripCard grid; "Invited" tab removed (US13b)~~
- [x] ~~Invitation banner on trip detail page: Accept/Decline buttons for invited users; hides Request to Join button (US15b)~~
- [ ] Full drag-drop itinerary builder
- [ ] Activity type as `<select>` (PH-specific presets) instead of free-text input
- [ ] Actual vs scheduled time tracking
- [ ] Itinerary sharing/export (PDF)
- [ ] Add boat/ferry transport type

## 8. Philippines-Specific Considerations

### 8.1 Geography & Transportation

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **82 Provinces** | All provinces mapped with geojson for Project 82 integration |
| **Island Hopping** | Boat/ferry as transport type for Palawan, Visayas, Mindanao trips |
| **Remote Areas** | Connectivity indicator for areas with no signal (Siargao, Batanes, etc.) |

### 8.2 Safety & Emergency

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Emergency Contacts** | LGU hotlines, nearest hospitals, police stations by municipality |
| **Weather Alerts** | PAGASA integration for typhoon/rain warnings during trip dates |
| **Location Sharing** | Share live location with emergency contact |

### 8.3 Data Sources

| Data | Source |
|------|--------|
| Province boundaries | `/public/geojson/*.geojson` (already exists) |
| Province metadata | `src/data/phProvinces.ts` (already exists) |
| Emergency contacts | To be sourced from LGU directories or DILG |
| Weather data | PAGASA or weather API |

## 9. Dependencies

- **Supabase** — Database and auth
- **PostGIS** — Spatial queries for location matching
- **MapBox** — Map display (existing)
- **R2/Cloudflare** — Image storage (existing)

*Last updated: 2026-02-21*
*Updated with PH-specific features: Offline itinerary, Emergency contacts, Boat/Ferry transport*
*Updated: Visibility and Status modals on trip detail page; `update_trip_status` RPC (026); `get_user_owned_trips` now returns visibility (025); `TripStatusActions` removed in favour of `StatusModal`*
*Updated: `DestinationModal` uses Mapbox Searchbox autocomplete (country=PH); `update_trip_destination` RPC (027) updates `locations` row + PostGIS geometry with `ST_MakePoint(lng::float8, lat::float8)`*
*Updated: Itinerary Phase 1–3 complete — crash fixes, query fix (location join + correct filter), `stops.ts` rewritten with correct DB columns (direct table ops), `activityEditor.ts` data-\* reading fixed, alert/confirm replaced with showToast/createConfirmModal, hidden+flex toggle fixed, dead files removed (CompleteItinerary.astro, FormTemplates.astro). Design decision: pickup/dropoff included in itinerary timeline; only destination excluded.*
*Updated: Mapbox Search Box (suggest+retrieve) integrated into inline add/edit stop forms (US18); DaySection type mismatch fixed (CompleteStop → ItineraryStop). New requirements added: US18a (pickup/dropoff in Add Stop, max 3 each per trip), US18b (time overlap validation within a day).*
*Updated: US18a — MAX_PICKUP/MAX_DROPOFF raised to 20 (was 3). US18b — `validateTimeOverlap()` checks full interval overlap or exact start-time collision; new stop form now defaults to after last stop + 15 min instead of current clock time.*
*Updated: "Joined" tab consolidated — new `get_user_participating_trips` RPC (028) returns joined + pending + invited in one call with `participation_status` field; "Invited" tab removed; TripCard extended with `participation_status` badge. Invitation banner on trip detail page shows Accept/Decline for invited users and hides Request to Join button.*
